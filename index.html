  				<p>The ‘More’ is design and manufacture of jewellery, cutting your gemstones for you and escorting you on tours of Vietnam and Thailand. In short, whatever you want, we can help you with it.</p>
  				<p>Here at Gems and More we have been happily serving customers since 2015.  The business was started by myself and my brother out of our mutual interest in gemstones. After retiring, I travelled to Bangkok, the coloured gem capital of the world and was amazed at the variety of gemstones and jewellery. I have a video you can see here xxxx of one of my many trips to the Jewellery Trade Centre in Bangkok.</p>
  				<p>n one of these trips, I was lucky enough to meet a jeweller, Rayhana. Her designs are exquisite, but importantly for me she speaks good English, as my Thai is terrible. She can design and make anything you want and she is very fussy about getting her jewellery just right. You can exchange ideas by email or talk directly to her on Skype. Why not join one of my tours and meet her in person to discuss your design needs.</p>
  				<p>I run tours to Vietnam and Thailand, with a theme of ‘Gemstones’ but with plenty of time to sightsee. The cost is between $100-$130aud per day and includes all accommodation, internal flights and some meals.</p>
  				<p>We also travel around Queensland and New South Wales attending Gem shows and other events, so you can meet us personally. We also offer a shop at home service based in Brisbane, but depending on where you are and where we are, maybe we can meet!</p>

				<h4 class="panel-body">How to Buy a Diamond.</h4>
				<p>The four ‘c’s for a Diamond, colour, clarity, cut and carat are important but unless you have some expertise, not overly relevant.</p>
				<p>The best Diamond is a colour ‘D’, clarity ‘IF’ (Internally Flawless), excellent cut and whatever size you like! A 1.0 carat Diamond is a lot more expensive than a comparable 0.9 carat gem and only an expert would be able to tell the difference in size when it is set in a ring.</p>
				<p>If you have $10 000 to spend, here is what you will get:</p>
				<table class="table col-xs-6">
					<tr class="danger">
						<th>Colour</th>
						<th>Carat</th>
						<th>Clarity</th>
					</tr>
					<tr class="warning">
						<td>D</td>
						<td>0.5</td>
						<td>SI (Slightly Included)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="danger">
						<td>E/F</td>
						<td>0.8</td>
						<td>SI</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="warning">
						<td>G/H</td>
						<td>1.0</td>
						<td>SI</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>The best way to buy a Diamond is simply decide on your budget and how large a Diamond you want, then the rest just follows on. Here is a simple exercise, go to any ‘Proper’ jeweller and ask them to show you some loose Diamonds in the price range you want. They should explain how the ‘Colours’ and clarity vary and you’ll soon see how important the colour is.</p>
				<h4 class="panel-body">NEVER BUY A DIAMOND:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>That has not been tested by a reputable laboratory.</li>
					<li>Whose colour is ‘I’, or worse...they are BROWN!</li>
					<li>A ‘Champagne’ Diamond...they are BROWN!</li>
					<li>That does not ‘Sparkle’. The sparkle means that it was well cut, a dull gem is probably poor quality and poorly cut.</li>
					<li>In Australia. It is sad but true that Diamonds are cheaper in Thailand.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>So if you want to buy a Diamond, you can deal with my Bangkok jeweller Rayhana. Her family are second generation dealers and deal directly with Diamond merchants. She can source you the stone you want for a 10% finders fee. I guarantee the quality of the Diamond.</p>
